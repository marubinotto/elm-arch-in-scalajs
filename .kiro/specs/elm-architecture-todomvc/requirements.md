# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves implementing the Elm Architecture pattern using Scala.js and building a TodoMVC application as a demonstration. The Elm Architecture is a pattern for architecting interactive programs that emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and unidirectional data flow. The implementation will provide a functional programming framework that can be used to build web applications with predictable state management, and the TodoMVC app will serve as a practical example of the architecture in action.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement the core Elm Architecture pattern in Scala.js, so that I can build functional web applications with predictable state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the architecture is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a Model type to represent application state
2. WHEN the architecture is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a Msg type to represent all possible state changes
3. WHEN the architecture is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide an update function that takes (Msg, Model) and returns a new Model
4. WHEN the architecture is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a view function that takes a Model and returns virtual DOM elements
5. WHEN the architecture is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide a runtime that manages the update loop and DOM rendering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create virtual DOM abstractions in Scala.js, so that I can declaratively describe UI components without direct DOM manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating virtual DOM elements THEN the system SHALL provide functions to create HTML elements with attributes and children
2. WHEN creating virtual DOM elements THEN the system SHALL support event handlers that emit messages
3. WHEN virtual DOM changes occur THEN the system SHALL efficiently update only the changed parts of the real DOM
4. WHEN rendering virtual DOM THEN the system SHALL handle text nodes, element nodes, and event listeners correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add new todo items, so that I can track tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I type in the new todo input field THEN the system SHALL update the input value in real-time
2. WHEN I press Enter in the new todo input field AND the input is not empty THEN the system SHALL add a new todo item to the list
3. WHEN I press Enter in the new todo input field AND the input is not empty THEN the system SHALL clear the input field
4. WHEN a new todo is added THEN the system SHALL assign it a unique identifier and set it as not completed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to mark todo items as completed or uncompleted, so that I can track my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the checkbox next to a todo item THEN the system SHALL toggle its completed status
2. WHEN a todo item is marked as completed THEN the system SHALL visually indicate its completed state (strikethrough text)
3. WHEN a todo item is marked as uncompleted THEN the system SHALL remove the completed visual indication
4. WHEN I click the "toggle all" checkbox THEN the system SHALL mark all todos as completed if any are incomplete, or mark all as incomplete if all are completed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit existing todo items, so that I can modify task descriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I double-click on a todo item THEN the system SHALL enter edit mode for that item
2. WHEN in edit mode THEN the system SHALL show an input field with the current todo text
3. WHEN I press Enter while editing THEN the system SHALL save the changes and exit edit mode
4. WHEN I press Escape while editing THEN the system SHALL cancel the changes and exit edit mode
5. WHEN I click outside the edit input THEN the system SHALL save the changes and exit edit mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete todo items, so that I can remove tasks I no longer need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I hover over a todo item THEN the system SHALL show a delete button (Ã—)
2. WHEN I click the delete button THEN the system SHALL remove that todo item from the list
3. WHEN I click "Clear completed" THEN the system SHALL remove all completed todo items from the list

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter todo items by their status, so that I can focus on specific types of tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL show filter options: All, Active, Completed
2. WHEN I click "All" THEN the system SHALL display all todo items
3. WHEN I click "Active" THEN the system SHALL display only uncompleted todo items
4. WHEN I click "Completed" THEN the system SHALL display only completed todo items
5. WHEN filtering is active THEN the system SHALL highlight the current filter option

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a count of remaining active todos, so that I can track how many tasks I have left.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are active todos THEN the system SHALL display the count of uncompleted items
2. WHEN the count is 1 THEN the system SHALL display "1 item left"
3. WHEN the count is not 1 THEN the system SHALL display "[count] items left"
4. WHEN all todos are completed THEN the system SHALL display "0 items left"

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TodoMVC app to follow the official TodoMVC specification, so that it can be compared with other framework implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL use the standard TodoMVC CSS styling
2. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL follow the TodoMVC HTML structure requirements
3. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL implement all required TodoMVC functionality
4. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases as specified in the TodoMVC guidelines
